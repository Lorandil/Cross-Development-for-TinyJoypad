# Cross Development Framework for TinyJoypad
This repository contains a small framework for developing games for the TinyJoypad using a more connective and resourceful micro controller like Arduino UNO, Leonardo, or Mega 2560 (and many more micro controllers).

## What is TinyJoypad?
TinyJoypad is a great project by the Canadian developer Daniel C which defines a standardized ATtiny85 gaming platform.
It consists of an ATtiny85, an SSD1306 driven I2C OLED, a joystyck, a button, a buzzer and some resistors.
The wiring of a TinyJoypad is simple and can be done on a breadboard or single sided prototype board.
A really cool feature is the module port which allows fast switching between games.

On https://www.tinyjoypad.com/ you will find the schematics and a lot of cool games.


## Sample Project
The sample project  will display an image of the iconic Rubjerg Knude Fyr. The image is 192x256 pixels (6kB) and can be scrolled with the joystick. For every movement a short blip sound is played.
 
The code works on TinyJoypad and on Arduino UNO/Leonardo/Mega 2560 (and probably many other controllers) without changing anything in the code!

## Why Should I Want to use Cross Development?
When I was developing for the TinyJoypad, most code didn't work as it was expected on the first try.
That's normal for development - and even more when developing on a micro controller with limited resources and without any debugging support.
Even if there would have been a possibility to use software serial, there is no free pin on the TinyJoypad!
So I spent a lot of time thinking about possible causes for my bigs, that's good brain training - but mostly frustrating (especially when the problem is something stupid like wrong parameter order). Thus I thought it would be great to test the code on a more powerful "machine".

At first I wanted to test the code on the PC, but the Arduino code is not pure C++ and it would have been difficult to check the rendered video output.

I thought that maybe I could get the <ssd1306xled> to work on an Arduino. A closer look into the code showed me, that this was above my abilities (because of the direct programming of the ATtiny registers for the I2C communication).
After some reflection I decided to try using the <Adafruit_SSD1306> library, which is available for many micro controllers (including several Arduinos).
And it worked - the Adafruit library supports direct access to the video buffer. Instead of writing a rendered byte directly to the display (as it is done on the ATtiny), the rendered data is stored in the video buffer and displayed when the buffer is complete.

Even sound output is possible (at least on Arduino UNO, Leonardo and Mega 2560, for other micro controllers a different port might be required).


## Advantages of using a more resourceful micro controller
* Serial debugging (by 'Serial.print()') is possible
* On newer micro controllers and with Arduino IDE 2.0 even live debugging using breakpoints should be possible
* Faster turn-around-cycles, because no cables need to be unplugged/plugged and no fiddling with modules or even chips
is necessary
* More memory to get things working - before optimizing for flash and RAM size (reducing readability)
* Additional cool features as dumping a screenshot to the serial interface as a hexdump


## How Does It Work?
Without an installed ATTiny85, the TinyJoypad is a passive device which offers all signals on the module connector J1.
That means, that we can use the display, the buzzer, the joystick and the fire buttons from the outside!
I just had to figure out the correct wiring and voil√†!
 
## Wiring for Arduino UNO, Leonardo and Mega 2560 with 5V Tolerant OLED Display
If your TinyJoypad display is 5V tolerant, you can directly connect the TinyJoypad's module port to the Arduino.

### PLEASE REMOVE THE BATTERY FROM THE TINYJOYPAD BEFORE CONNECTING !!!

 
| TinyJoypad J1    | Function      | UNO R3        | MEGA2560      | Leonardo      |
| ---------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Pin 1 (leftmost) | left/right    | A0            | A0            | A0            |
| Pin 2            | up/down       | A3            | A3            | A3            |
| Pin 3            | buzzer        | `D12`         | `D10`         | `D8`          |
| Pin 4            | GND           | GND           | GND           | GND           |
| Pin 5            | SDA (i2c)     | SDA           | SDA           | SDA           |
| Pin 6            | fire          | A1            | A1            | A1            |
| Pin 7            | SCL (i2c)     | SCL           | SCL           | SCL           |
| Pin 8 (rightmost)| VCC           | VCC           | VCC           | VCC           |
 
Please note that the connection of pin 3 differs between the controllers due to the location of PB4!


## Wiring for Other Micro Controllers and non 5V Tolerant Displays
My first intuition was to simply use a level shifter. That works great for the display, the beeper and the fire button, but sadly *NOT for the direction buttons because these are analog inputs*.
It's probably the easiest solution to use a level shifter where possible and voltage dividers for the two analog inputs.


## How Do I Get the Same Software Running on TinyJoypad and Other Micro Controllers?
I encapsulated all hardware related code into special functions, so that in your application code there is no need 
for any special treatment on which controller the program is running!
The overhead of these functions is zero or nearly zero because the compiler will inline most of the code.
If your flash memory gets really low at the end of your project, you are free to try inlining the code by yourself.

 
### Here is a simplified version of the code without the bitmap and joystick stuff:
For the full version please check out the sketch in the repository!

## Definitions of the Required Functions
```javascript
#include "tinyJoypadUtils.h"
```

## Initilization of the TinyJoypad I/O-Pins and the Display
```javascript
/*--------------------------------------------------------*/
void setup()
{
  // initialize the pins (and serial port if present)
  InitTinyJoypad();
  // perform display initialization
  InitDisplay();
}
```

## Cyclic Image Rendering Call
```javascript
/*--------------------------------------------------------*/
void loop()
{
  // render the image
  Tiny_Flip();  
}
```

## Render and Display the Image
 ```javascript
/*--------------------------------------------------------*/
void Tiny_Flip()
{
  // there are 8 rows with a height of 8 pixels
  for ( uint8_t y = 0; y < 8; y++)
  {
    // prepare display of row <y>
    TinyFlip_PrepareDisplayRow( y );

    // there are 128 columns of 8 vertical aligned pixels
    for ( uint8_t x = 0; x < 128; x++ )
    {
      // get the pixels from somewhere
      uint8_t pixels = ...
      // send 8 vertical pixels to the display
      TinyFlip_SendPixels( pixels );
    }
    
    // this row has been finished
    TinyFlip_FinishDisplayRow();
  }

  // display the whole screen
  TinyFlip_DisplayBuffer();
}
```


## What are the Remaining Differences?
If the micro controllers are of comparable types like ATMEGA328 (Arduino Uno) or MEGA2560 (Arduino Mega 2560) or AVR32U4 (Arduino Leonardo), the only differences you might notice will be:

* The drawing of the image: Because the TinyJoypad has not enough RAM to render the output image in memory, the image is rendered while it is displayed. Depending on the speed of the calculations, this can be visible. The Adafruit library uses a RAM buffer for storing the rendered image. After rendering is complete, the image will be transfered in one piece, looking snappier.

* The brightness of the OLED and the loudness of the beeper might be higher when using a 5V micro controller (due to the increased voltage).

If your controller is much faster, you might see increased speed to the point, that your project (especially the controls) will begin to behave differently.
You might counter that effect with `#ifdef` and `_delay_ms()`, but it's probably easier to stay with the above mentioned AVR chips.
